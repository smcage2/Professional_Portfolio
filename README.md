# Week Challenge: Advanced CSS Challenge: Professional Portfolio

## Description
This week, I will create a portfolio page to showcase my skills and talents to employers. My portfolio will highlight my strongest work and the thought processes behind it. Having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies, so this challenge is a great opportunity for me to practice flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables while creating something useful for the job search.
